How to run maxima script from wxMaxima.

For example, to run the program Tin.mac using wxMaxima, you would use its
menu option File/Batch File.
If you do this, wxMaxima will also display the
command batch("Tin.mac") that can be used in a Konsole window.

See Magnus.wxm: there is a line

batch("Magnus.mac");

which runs Magnus.mac within wxMaxima.
