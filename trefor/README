Hear we collect different versions of trefor.

You may run

buildTrf.sh

to build the standard version written in C is in ctrf2005.

If it is not OK, to begin building modern trefor, first go to ctrf2005 and read README there.
Just do 

 make 

there and follow the instructions in README.
For more details on Trefor language: read tex and html documentation.

Another way is to go to trfor.new directory.
Here one can build old reliable trefor executable using a fortran compiler 
from *.for sources and from *.trf sources 
(if trf is working in any version, e.g. from ctrf) -- read README in trfor.new.

Thus go to trfor.new and do 
 make -f *trefor95trf.mak 
there, with a version of trefor95trf.mak suitable for your compiler, e.g. gftrefor95trf.mak.
