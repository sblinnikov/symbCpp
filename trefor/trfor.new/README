Here one can build old reliable trefor from *.for sources and from
*.trf sources (if trf is working in any version)

If trf works already and you want new t95 go to Section 2.

Section 1. 

If trf is not installed yet or you want another version of trf
(building not from C source but from fortran source):

Initial (very old) make working now is for Lahey-Fujutsu compiler (lf95)
 make -f lffor.mak
from .for files

Other makefiles require explicit -save, or equivalent options like -fno-automatic

Both ifcfor.mak for intel fortran and gffor.mak for gfortran are working now:

   make -f ifcfor.mak clean
   make -f ifcfor.mak

   make -f gffor.mak clean
   make -f gffor.mak

On the next stage trefor is built from *trf source.

make -f trefortrf.mak clean
make -f trefortrf.mak trefor
will make otrefor

To test trefor (after successful build), without a wrapper trf, run simply:

  ./trefor sel.trf . 1
or
  ./otrefor sel.trf . 1
etc.

To install

sudo mv trf trefor /usr/local/bin/

or 

sudo mv trf otrefor /usr/local/bin/

etc.

Use the needed version of trefor in .trfrc in your home dir.


Section 2. 

If trf works in any version then you can build t95.

For gfortran

 make -f gftrefor95trf.mak

use options t95 and trefor95:

 make -f gftrefor95trf.mak t95

 make -f gftrefor95trf.mak trefor95

-- it will build t95-wrapper and btrefor95 preprocessor.

The same for ifort:

 make -f trefor95trf.mak 

Use trefor95trf.mak and change variable SYSTYPE there for other compilers.


To install

sudo mv t95 btrefor95 /usr/local/bin/

Do not forget

cp -i sample.trnrc ~/.trnrc

and edit ~/.trnrc for your fortran compiler, editor, viewer etc.
