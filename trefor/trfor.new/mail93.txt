trefor

Hi,Sergej !
I think the only problem with Trefor implementation on SUN is
the @eqbyte. TREFOR has three arguments:
1: name of program
2: temp. region for fortran and listing files
3: 1 - listing, 0 - no listing

I think that easy way is "TREFOR name.ext . 1"


Could you make the copy of SN1993J image ?

    A PostScript Finding chart of SN 1993J is available through
anonymous ftp at cfa0.harvard.edu (128.103.40.1).  It is in 
the directory pub/brian/  and you can get the compressed
version 93J.finder.ps.Z (use UNIX uncompress), or the full
PostScript File "93J.finder.ps".  Print it out on a PostScript
printer with 1 Mbyte of memory or more.

SUPERNOVA 1993J IN NGC 3031
     J. Ripero, Madrid, Spain, reports that F. Garcia, Lugo, Spain,
discovered a possible supernova on Mar. 28 as much as 5' southwest
of the nucleus of NGC 3031 = M81.  The object was also recorded in an
ST-4 CCD image obtained by D. Rodriguez as some 30" northeast of a
mag 14 foreground star.  Magnitude estimates: Mar.26.9 UT, [14.0 (Garcia
and P. Pujol); 28.86, 12.0 (Garcia, visual), 29.1, 11.8 (Rodriguez, CCD
unfiltered); 29.88, 11.3 (Pujol); 29.88, 11.0 (Rodriguez).
 
     A. V. Filippenko, University of California at Berkeley, reports:
"A CCD image of M81 obtained on Mar. 30.1 UT by R. R. Treffers
and Y. Paik (also of Berkeley) with the 0.8-m reflector at Leuschner
Observatory confirms the presence of a new stellar object roughly
45" west and 160" south of the nucleus.  The visual magnitude is
approximately 11.  Inspection of CCD spectra (range 356-731 nm)
obtained on Mar. 30.3 by M. Davis and D. Schlegel (also of Berkeley)
with the Lick 3-m Shane reflector reveals that the object is indeed
a supernova.  The continuum is very blue and remarkably featureless.
The only clear absorption lines are narrow Na I D and Ca II H + K,
undoubtedly of interstellar origin.  It is probable, but not yet
certain, that the object is a type II supernova observed only a few
days after the explosion.  Note, however, that the type Ia SN 1991T
exhibited a relatively featureless spectrum well before maximum
brightness (Filippenko et al. 1992, Ap.J. 384, L15).  Depending on its
spectral type, distance and extinction, SN 1993J may reach eighth
magnitude during the next two weeks.  Aside from SN 1987A in the LMC,
it is therefore the brightest supernova since SN 1972E in NGC 5253.
Further observations throughout the electromagnetic spectrum are urged."
 
     F. D. A. Hartwick, D. D. Balam, D. Zurek and R. M. Robb,
Climenhaga Observatory, University of Victoria, provide the following
precise position for the supernova, measured by Balam from a CCD image
obtained with the 0.5-m reflector on Mar. 30.25 UT: R.A. =
9h51m19s.27, Decl. = +69D15'25".7 (equinox 1950.0).  Photometry
yields V = 10.2 +/- 0.1.
 
     P. Garnavich and B. A. Hong, Dominion Astrophysical Observatory,
communicate: "Spectra (range 550-690 nm, resolution 0.6 nm) of the
supernova were taken with the DAO 1.8-m telescope on Mar. 30.25 UT.
The spectrum shows a strong, flat continuum with weak H alpha and He I
587.5 nm) features, consistent with that of a type II supernova."

ALPHA PISCIS AUSTRINI
     S. A. Stern, Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio; M. C.
Festou, Observatoire Midi-Pyrenees, Toulouse; and D. A. Weintraub,
Vanderbilt University, Nashville, report: "Mapping observations on
Feb. 20-21 revealed 1.3-mm continuum emission in a broad, disk-like
region around the nearby, main-sequence star alpha PsA (Fomalhaut, A3V;
distance 6.7 pc).  The observations supporting this discovery were made
using the 7-channel MPIfR bolometer of the IRAM 30-m telescope on Pico
Vileta, with a halfpower bandwidth at 1.3 mm of 12".  The emission
geometry appears to be a tilted disk with the position angle of the
major axis near 100 deg and an aspect ratio of 2:1; the major-axis
emission exceeds 20 mJy at the 450-500-AU contour (about 1' from the star).
Additional emission may be present at larger distances.  The peak 1.3-mm
emission detected is 50 mJy, centered on the line of sight to the star.
The emission is ascribed to an assemblage of cold, orbiting dust grains
around the star.  Although IRAS revealed that Fomalhaut is an infrared-
excess source, these observations constitute the first detection of this
extended, disk-like emission.  Thus, after beta Pic (also A3V), this is
the second main-sequence star to have a detected disk, and the disk is
the first one around a main-sequence star to be mapped in thermal
emission.  The fact that alpha PsA is 2.5 times closer to the earth
than beta Pic is makes it an ideal object for intensive study."
 
SU TAURI
     This R-CrB variable is fading, as indicated by the following
visual magnitude estimates, communicated mainly by B. H. Granslo,
Fjellhamar, Norway: Mar. 20.51, 10.0 (M. Iida, Nagano, Japan); 23.42,
10.2 (M. Yamada,  Ishikawa, Japan); 25.84, 10.4 (Granslo); 26.47,
10.5 (Yamada); 27.44, 10.8 (Yamada); 28.85, 11.3 (Granslo); 29.82,
11.6 (Granslo).
 
 
COMET SHOEMAKER-LEVY (1993e)
     A. Cochran, University of Texas, reports that she obtained
spectra (range 300-570 nm) of this comet with the large cassegrain
spectrograph on the McDonald Observatory's 2.7-m telescope on Mar. 28.
The long slit was placed along the major axis of the object.  A
preliminary look at the raw data shows no obvious emissions.  The
comet was approximately uniformly bright over the inner 30".  There was
an approximately uniform section of lower intensity to a total length of
1'.  A weak condensation was visible near the western end.

SUPERNOVA 1993K IN NGC 2223
     A. Williams, University of Western Australia; and R. Martin,
Perth Observatory, report their discovery of a possible supernova
of mag 14.5 approximately 30" east and 31" north of the nucleus of
NGC 2223 (R.A. = 6h22m.5, Decl. = -22D49', equinox 1950.0).  The
discovery was made on Mar. 28.55 UT in the course of the Perth
Observatory Research Group's automated supernova search program,
using the 0.61-m Perth-Lowell automated telescope.  The object was
reobserved on Mar. 29.5, but it had not been present on Mar. 10.5 UT.
 
     P. C. Schmidtke, Arizona State University, obtained BVRI images
of the field with the 0.9-m telescope at the Cerro Tololo Interamerican
Observatory, starting on Mar. 30.09 UT.  He confirmed the presence
of a star approximately 30" east and 28" north of the center of the
galaxy, quick-look photometry yielding V = 15.4, B-V = +0.2, V-R = +0.1.
 
     M. M. Phillips, Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory, reports
that J. Maza and M. Wischnjewsky, University of Chile, obtained a
low-resolution spectrum (range 320-760 nm) of the object with the CTIO
1.5-m telescope.  The spectrum is essentially featureless, suggesting
that this supernova--like 1993J--is a type II event in an early stage.
 
 
SUPERNOVA 1993J IN NGC 3031
     G. Gomez, Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias; and R. Lopez,
University of Barcelona, report: "A spectrum (range 500-850 nm,
resolution 0.3 nm) taken on Mar. 30 by E. Perez with the 2.5-m Isaac
Newton Telescope shows some similarity to the premaximum spectrum
of the type II supernova 1990E.  In particular, there is a very broad
(FWZI about 70 nm) emission band toward 650 nm that could correspond
to H alpha."
 
     Corrigenda.  On IAUC 5731, the names P. Pujol and B. A. Hong
should have been given as F. Pujol and H. B. Ann, respectively, and
the time of the first CCD image should have been Mar. 28.89, rather
than Mar. 29.1.
 
     Further visual magnitude estimates: Mar. 29.95 UT, 11.1 (F.
Garcia, Lugo, Spain); 30.84, 10.3 (P. Schmeer, Bischmisheim, Germany).

SUPERNOVA 1993I IN MCG +2-32-144
     M. Turatto, C. Zanin and V. Buondi, Asiago Observatory, confirm
the existence of this object on CCD frames taken with the 1.8-m
telescope on Feb. 28, when the object, located 13".5 west and 8".4
south of the galaxy's nucleus, had B = 17.95, B-V = +0.20.
 
     A. Clocchiatti and J. C. Wheeler, University of Texas, report that a
spectrum (range 450-720 nm, dispersion 0.34 nm/pixel) obtained on Mar.
29.3 UT with the 2.7-m telescope of the McDonald Observatory shows
that SN 1993I is of type Ia close to maximum light.  The typical
spectral features show a redshift consistent with the radial velocity
of MCG +02-32-144 (12 924 km/s) reported by Zwicky in Stars and
Stellar Systems 8, 375.
 
 
GRO J0422+32
     C. Chevalier and S. A. Ilovaisky, Observatoire de Haute-Provence,
report: "New CCD photometry of the optical counterpart of this x-ray
transient has been obtained with the Haute-Provence 1.2-m telescope on
Jan. 19-23, Feb. 10-20 and Mar. 12-13.  When combined with the earlier
January data (IAUC 5692) our 1993 observations made on 23 nights over
a 2.5-month interval show that, after a slow-down in its decline during
early January just after the secondary x-ray maximum (IAUC 5685), the
average decline rate returned to a value near 0.01 mag/day, close to
what was seen earlier in the outburst (IAUC 5644, 5650).  This decay
rate is half that seen in V616 Mon = A0620-00 during its 1975 outburst.
On 1993 Mar. 13 the optical counterpart of GRO J0422+32 was 1.4 mag
fainter in V than in early Sept. 1992 when we started our monitoring
program.  Calibration of our differential photometry using Guide Star
Photometric Catalogue stars gives V = 14.6 for this March observation.
The 5.1-hr periodic modulation detected in the January data was also
present in February but with a reduced amplitude."

NOTICE TO SUBSCRIBERS
     As an experiment, the Central Bureau decided not to issue
telegrams (telexes, mailgrams) recently, specifically with regard
to the comets and supernovae discovered during the past week.  It
has been felt for some time that the Circulars are getting such
rapid and wide distribution electronically that the telegrams have
become superfluous.  There are now very few countries with active
observatories that cannot receive electronic mail, and any amateur
astronomer who subscribes to a widespread network, such as
Compuserve, can also easily subscribe to the e-mail Circulars.  It
certainly seems not to be the case that the absence of telegrams in
the past week has caused important observations to be missed.  On
the other hand, in comparison with the Circulars, the telegrams
contain extremely little information, and they are also expensive
both for subscribers to receive and for the Central Bureau to send
(and to maintain address lists with the telegraph company).  Comments
from telegram subscribers are solicited.  Unless there are good
reasons for continuing the telegram service, the Central Bureau would
like to phase it out, transferring any remaining credit balances to
the corresponding Circulars accounts.

SUPERNOVA 1993J in NGC 3031
    Spectrograms obtained with the 1.93-m Observatoire de Haute Provence
telescope by Y. Andrillat on Mar. 30.95 UT showed no feature in the
region of the near-infrared Ca II triplet.  On Mar. 31.00 H alpha was
detected in emission with an equivalent width of 0.03 nm and a FWHM of
190 km/s.
 
     CCD photometry by P. Prugniel at the 0.8-m Observatoire de Haute
Provence telescope on Mar. 31.00 UT gave B = 11.05, B-R = +0.3.
 
     J.-M. Perelmuter, Observatoire du Mont Megantic, Universite de
Montreal, notes the presence on Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope 1980
plates and Kitt Peak National Observatory 1990 CCD images of an object
within 0".2 of the position of SN 1993J quoted by Hartwick et al.
on IAUC 5731.  The object appears stellar on images with FWHM as small
as 1".0 and had V = 20.0, B-V = +1.1, V-R = +0.7 (uncertainty 0.1 mag)
in Mar. 1990.
 
     Visual magnitude estimates: Mar. 30.94 UT, 10.5 (J. D. Shanklin,
Cambridge, England); 31.1, 10 (R. Kohl, Lakewood, NY; independent
discovery); 31.13, 10.5 (F. Cianciolo, R. Gearhart and A. Dosaj,
Austin, TX).
 
 
SUPERNOVA 1993K IN NGC 2223
     M. Della Valle, European Southern Observatory; and J. M. Alcala,
Landessternwarte, Heidelberg, report: "Analysis of a spectrogram
(range 480-710 nm, resolution about 0.5 nm) obtained with the 1.52-m
telescope at La Silla on Mar.31.0 UT shows a featureless blue continuum,
indicating a possible type II supernova caught during an early stage."
 
    G.Massone, Osservatorio di Torino, reports the following magnitudes,
obtained on Mar. 31.1 UT with the 0.9-m Dutch telescope at La Silla:
V = 15.3, B-V = +0.1, V-R = +0.2.
 
     P.C.Schmidtke, Arizona State University, provides further BVRI
photometry with the 0.9-m telescope at the Cerro Tololo Interamerican
Observatory.  Quick-look estimates, starting on Mar. 31.12 UT, gave V =
15.3, B-V = +0.2, V-R = +0.2 (uncertainty 0.1 mag).

SUPERNOVA 1993J IN NGC 3031
     M. Richmond, Princeton University, provides the following J2000.0
position of the supernova, reduced from the Treffers CCD images (IAUC
5731) using the Guide Star Catalogue: R.A. = 9h55m25s.00, Decl. =
+69D01'13".3.  The corresponding end figures for the position by
Hartwick et al. (IAUC 5731) are 25s.00, 13".7.  Richmond gives the
offset from the mag 14 foreground star mentioned on IAUC 5731 (= GSC
4383.0340) as 7".4 east, 24".3 north (7".2 east, 24".3 north at 1950.0).
     W. van Driel, Institute of Astronomy, University of Tokyo, reports:
"On Mar. 25.60 UT an R-band CCD image of M81 was obtained with the
1.05-m Schmidt telescope at the Kiso Observatory by K.-I. Wakamatsu and
myself.  The 5-min exposure was made through a thin cloud layer.  We can
not see the supernova in this image, though we can see the mag 17 star
50" due north of GSC 4383.0340.  On Mar. 31 we took R and V band images
of the supernova for comparison.  The Kiso CCD is 1018 x 1000 pixels of
0".75 square each, giving a field-of-view of about 12'.7 x 12'.5.  We
have performed the bias substraction and flatfielding of the images."
     A. V. Filippenko, University of California at Berkeley, notes:
"The V magnitude and colors (B-V, V-R) of the starlike object reported
on IAUC 5736 at the position of SN 1993J are consistent
with those of an unreddened or slightly reddened K0 Ia supergiant at
the distance of NGC 3031 (distance modulus 27.5 mag).  On page 16 of
the Atlas of Galaxies by Sandage and Bedke (1988) the object is
clearly visible as a stellar or semistellar condensation in the middle
of a spiral arm.  An extended progenitor (red supergiant, rather than
blue supergiant like that of SN 1987A) is consistent with the fact
that SN 1993J is not subluminous in B."
     J. C. Wheeler, University of Texas at Austin, reports: "E. Barker
obtained an essentially featureless spectrum from 300 to 840 nm with
the es2 spectrograph on the 2.1-m telescope at the McDonald Observatory
on Mar. 31.2 UT.  D. Lester, N. Gaffney and B. Smith obtained spectra
with the McDonald Observatory infrared spectrometer on the 2.7-m
telescope, covering the J and K bands at low (R = 100-200) resolution.
These spectra are also basically featureless with no evidence for
Brackett, Paschen or He lines.  Approximate photometry is K = 10.6, J =
10.9 on Mar. 31.2."
     Visual magnitude estimate by M. V. Zanotta and S. Pesci (Milan,
Italy): Mar. 31.84 UT, 10.5.
 
     Corrigendum.  IAUC 5733: for FWZI about 70 nm read FWZI about
37 nm.
